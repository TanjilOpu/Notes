1. #include <sstream> 
directive includes the String Stream library, which provides classes 
like std::stringstream, std::istringstream, and std::ostringstream to treat strings as I/O streams 
for in-memory formatting, type conversion (e.g., number-to-string and vice-versa), and string parsing.


2. #include<limits>
Common Use: Accessing the maximum and minimum possible values for a given type, determining its size, or checking if it's signed.

3. #include<algorithm>
It contains non-member functions that implement common algorithms like sorting, searching, modifying, and comparing data sequences.

4.#include<cctype>
certain category type like(ischar,islower,isupper,isdigit)

#include<cppconn/driver.h>
#include<cppconn/connection.h>
#include<cppconn/statement.h>            //used for executing SQL queries (like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE) without parameters.
#include<cppconn/prepared_statement.h>   //Provides sql::PreparedStatement class – lets you write parameterized queries safely.(Prevents SQL injection and is faster for repeated queries.)
#include<cppconn/resultset.h>          //select all form .............
#include<cppconn/exception.h>

driver + connection → connect to MySQL
statement + prepared_statement → send queries
resultset → read query results
exception → catch errors safely
